# canvas-meme-gen

Simple (and fairly dated) meme generator using canvas API for learning purposes. You can 'upload' (not actually stored anywhere) an image to use as a background for a meme. You can input meme header and footer text to overlay on the given image. Clicking save doesn't save anything, instead it opens the created meme to a new tab. Note: Might not work properly in Chrome due to antiquated usage of `window.open`.
